opus_libre is written by Valentin Villenave (http://valentin.villenave.net/).

None of this would have been possible without LilyPond, the GNU music typesetter,
created by Han-Wen Nienhuys and Jan Nieuwenhuizen and developed by a large number
of contributors.

This framework uses functions and concepts specifically designed by:
  - Rune Zedeler
  - Joe Neeman
  - Reinhold Kainhofer
  - Neil Puttock
  - Mats Bengtsson
  - Jay Anderson
  - Nicolas Sceaux
... and many ideas given by my countless friends in the LilyPond community!

Development was made using the GIT version tracker, created by Linus Torvalds
and maintained by Junio Hamano, under the GNU/Linux operating system.
