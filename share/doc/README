opus_libre is a framework for the GNU LilyPond music notation software.

It originated with the Opera Libre project, a large music score that
was written, published, performed and recorded using only Free Software.

opus_libre is designed with portability in mind, to make it easier to
create new scores as well as to integrate existing ones within the
framework.  It should also eventually have support for graphic themes,
input/edition languages choice, automatic scores inclusion using
predefined skeletons, etc.

LilyPond is a GNU Free software that is both powerful and simple to
learn, and that you can download on http://www.lilypond.org.
It runs on most modern Operating Systems, and has been
ported for various architectures.

More documentation will be added later; for now, you may learn more
about LilyPond on its official website or on the community website
http://www.lilynet.net.

My own music is stored in various branches of the opus_libre.git
project, and my Opera Libre project may be found on
http://repo.or.cz/w/opera_libre.git, or on my personal website
http://valentin.villenave.net.
