Op√©ra Libre is written by Valentin Villenave (http://valentin.villenave.net/).
Most of the text was written by Lewis Trondheim (http://lewistrondheim.com/).

None of this would have been possible without LilyPond, the GNU music typesetter,
created by Han-Wen Nienhuys and Jan Nieuwenhuizen and developed by a large number
of contributors.

This scores uses functions and concepts specifically designed by:
  - Rune Zedeler
  - Joe Neeman
  - Reinhold Kainhofer
  - Neil Puttock
  - Mats Bengtsson
  - Jay Anderson
  - Nicolas Sceaux
... and many ideas given by my countless friends in the LilyPond community!

The code was entirely written using the Free jEdit editor, created by Slava Pestov,
and Bertalan Fodor's wonderful LilyPondTool plugin (much more than a plugin
actually).  Development was made using the GIT version tracker, created by Linus
Torvalds and maintained by Junio Hamano, under the GNU/Linux operating system.
