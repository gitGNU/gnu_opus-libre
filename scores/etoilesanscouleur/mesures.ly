%- Beaming rules --------------------------------------------------%

%%% Default LilyPond beaming is pretty dumb and ugly.
%%% (Or perhaps I may have a peculiar taste.)
%%% OTOH, I'm not sure I'll want these settings for
%%% other scores yet to come. Thus, I'm just overwriting
%%% the modern-time-signature-settings locally here,
%%% without merging these changes into the master branch.

#(define-public modern-time-signature-settings
  (append
    '(
      ((3 . 2) .
                ((beamExceptions . ((end . (((1 . 12) . (3 3 3 3 3 3))))))))
      ((3 . 4) .
                ((beamExceptions . ((end . (((1 . 8) . (2 2 2))))))))
